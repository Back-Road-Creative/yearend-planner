# Year-End Tax & Retirement Planner

A Windows program that reads the tax documents you drop into a folder, computes your
taxes with [PolicyEngine US](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-us), shows what
is still missing, surfaces every tax lever, and at filing time hands you a complete tax
package. Deterministic, local, no account, no cloud, no LLM at runtime.

Status: Phase 0 (foundations). See the build plan for the phases.

## Use (Windows)

1. Download `yearend-planner-<version>-win64.zip`, right-click → Properties → **Unblock**.
2. Extract it anywhere local (not OneDrive, Dropbox or another synced folder).
3. Double-click `planner.cmd`.

Everything personal stays under `data/` and `out/` inside that folder.

## Develop

```
uv sync --frozen --extra dev
uv run pytest            # add -m "not engine" to skip the ~1 min engine case
uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check . && uv run mypy planner tests
uv run --no-project python scripts/build_release.py   # dist/yearend-planner-<v>-win64.zip
```

CI runs the suite on Ubuntu and Windows and proves the release zip on a clean Windows
runner (`scripts/windows_proof.ps1`): real calculation, path with a space and non-ASCII
characters, moved folder, network blocked, standard user, cloud-sync folder refused.

same terms.

## Engine (Phase 1)

`planner compute <household.yaml>` prints every figure for one household-year as JSON:
federal income tax after credits, SE tax, total tax (1040 line 24), tax attributable to
qualified dividends and long-term gains, NC tax, AGI, ACA MAGI, taxable income, QBI
deduction, premium tax credit, FPL percentages, monthly Medicaid MAGI, and the headroom
left under the 0% capital-gains ceiling and the top of the 12% bracket. All figures come
from policyengine-us; the only arithmetic here is threshold minus taxable income.

`planner sweep <household.yaml> --variable taxable_roth_conversions --lo 0 --hi 100000 --step 5000`
runs the whole range in one engine call.

`planner verify data/private/returns/<year>.yaml` recomputes a filed year from the inputs
recorded in that file and prints each line as filed next to the engine's figure. The file
format is `tests/fixtures/2025_return.yaml` (synthetic); your own lives under
`data/private/` and is never committed.

`planner update <release.zip> --sha256 <digest>` verifies the zip, extracts it to
`python-candidate/`, runs the candidate's own selfcheck, then swaps it in and keeps the old
install as `python-previous/`. `planner update --rollback` restores it. `data/` and `out/`
are never touched.

Reference cases (hand-worked, $1 tolerance) are in `tests/test_tax.py`; the engine's
coverage of each rule the planner relies on is recorded in `config/capabilities.yaml`.
